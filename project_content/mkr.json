The core idea is to create DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, through a system of collateralized debt positions (CDPs). Users lock up cryptocurrencies as collateral to generate DAI, which can then be used for various purposes within the crypto ecosystem. The MKR token is used for governance and to stabilize the system. If DAI falls below its target price, MKR tokens are burned to reduce the supply. The project solves the problem of volatility in the crypto market by providing a stable and decentralized currency for transactions and savings. The whitepaper details the mechanisms for maintaining DAI's peg, the role of MKR holders in governance, and the overall architecture of the Sky protocol."
