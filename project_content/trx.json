The core idea is to eliminate intermediaries like YouTube or Spotify, allowing creators to connect directly with their audience and receive TRX tokens as payment. The innovation lies in its high-throughput blockchain designed to handle a large volume of transactions, making it suitable for content sharing and other applications. TRX is used to pay creators, reward users, and participate in network governance. The whitepaper addresses the problem of centralized control over digital content and the unfair distribution of revenue, proposing a fairer and more transparent ecosystem where creators are empowered. TRON aims to be the foundation for a new era of decentralized entertainment and content creation."
