The core innovation lies in separating yield-bearing tokens into their principal and yield components, enabling users to speculate on yield fluctuations or lock in fixed returns. The PENDLE token is used for governance, staking, and incentivizing liquidity. Pendle addresses the problem of limited flexibility in managing yield-bearing assets, empowering users to tailor their investment strategies and manage risk more effectively. By bringing sophisticated financial tools to the DeFi space, Pendle aims to create a more efficient and accessible market for yield trading. The platform's design prioritizes composability, allowing it to integrate with other DeFi protocols and expand its functionality. Ultimately, Pendle seeks to democratize access to advanced financial strategies and empower users to take control of their crypto investments."
