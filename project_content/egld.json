The core innovation is adaptive state sharding, which dynamically divides the network into smaller shards that can process transactions in parallel. This allows MultiversX to achieve significantly higher transaction throughput and lower latency compared to traditional blockchains. The EGLD token is used for transaction fees, staking (securing the network), and governance (participating in decisions about the future of the network). The whitepaper emphasizes the need for a highly scalable and efficient blockchain to support a wide range of decentralized applications and drive the adoption of blockchain technology in various industries. By solving the scalability problem, MultiversX aims to create a more accessible and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem."
