The core idea is to create a platform where users are incentivized to trade, provide liquidity, and engage with the community through the MOCA token. This token serves as both a reward mechanism and a governance tool, allowing token holders to vote on important platform decisions.\n\nThe innovation lies in its robust rewards system, designed to attract and retain users. By distributing MOCA tokens to active participants, Mocaverse aims to create a more vibrant and sustainable ecosystem. The whitepaper addresses the problem of high fees and lack of transparency often found on centralized exchanges. Mocaverse offers a decentralized alternative where users have more control over their funds and can trade directly with each other, fostering a more equitable and accessible financial system."
