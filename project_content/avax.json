Avalanche introduces a family of consensus protocols that allow for the creation of multiple subnets, each with its own rules and virtual machines. The AVAX token is used for staking, governance, and transaction fees within the Avalanche network. The whitepaper highlights Avalanche's ability to solve the blockchain trilemma \u2013 achieving decentralization, security, and scalability simultaneously. By offering a highly customizable and efficient platform, Avalanche aims to enable a new generation of decentralized applications and services."
