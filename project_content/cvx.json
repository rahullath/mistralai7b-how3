Convex aggregates these deposited tokens and uses them to vote on Curve's governance, maximizing rewards for its users. The CVX token is used for governance within the Convex platform, allowing holders to vote on important decisions. By streamlining the yield farming process and boosting returns, Convex solves the problem of complexity and inefficiency in the Curve ecosystem, making it more accessible and profitable for a wider range of users."
