The core idea is to create a \"relay chain\" that acts as a central hub, allowing \"parachains\" (independent blockchains) to plug in and communicate with each other. This solves the problem of isolated blockchains, enabling interoperability and collaboration. The DOT token is used for governance, staking (securing the network), and bonding (securing parachain slots). The whitepaper emphasizes the importance of scalability, security, and adaptability, aiming to create a blockchain platform that can evolve and adapt to future technological advancements. Polkadot aims to be the internet of blockchains, fostering a more connected and efficient crypto ecosystem. It's all about making blockchains work together, not in isolation."
