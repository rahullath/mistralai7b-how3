Gravity aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions by operating as a Layer 2 solution built on top of an existing blockchain. The core innovation lies in its efficient transaction processing mechanism, allowing for a higher throughput than the main chain. The GZRO token is used to incentivize participation in the network, reward validators, and pay for transaction fees. By addressing the limitations of scalability, Gravity seeks to make blockchain technology more accessible and practical for everyday use cases, fostering wider adoption and enabling new applications in areas like DeFi and gaming. The whitepaper details the technical architecture, consensus mechanism, and economic model designed to achieve these goals."
