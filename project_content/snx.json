This may limit participation for users with smaller portfolios.\n\n*   **Smart Contract Risks**: Like all DeFi projects, Synthetix is susceptible to smart contract vulnerabilities. Bugs or exploits in the code could potentially lead to loss of funds."

The core innovation lies in using collateralized debt pools to back these Synths, enabling traders to gain exposure to a wide range of assets without directly owning them. The SNX token plays a crucial role in the system, acting as collateral and providing staking rewards to incentivize participation and secure the network. Synthetix aims to solve the problem of limited asset availability in the crypto space by bringing traditional financial instruments to the decentralized world. By creating a permissionless and transparent platform, Synthetix empowers users to access diverse investment opportunities and participate in global markets. The whitepaper details the mechanisms for creating, trading, and managing Synths, as well as the economic incentives that drive the ecosystem."
