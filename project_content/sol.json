The SOL token is used to pay for transaction fees and participate in network governance. Solana aims to solve the limitations of existing blockchains by providing a platform that can handle a high volume of transactions at low cost, enabling a wider range of applications, from decentralized finance to gaming. The whitepaper emphasizes the importance of a scalable and efficient blockchain for the future of decentralized applications. Solana's goal is to make blockchain technology accessible and practical for everyday use."
