The core innovation lies in its use of specialized bonding curves that minimize slippage, especially for large trades. The CRV token serves as the governance token, allowing holders to participate in the DAO and influence the platform's development. CRV also incentivizes liquidity providers by rewarding them with tokens and a share of trading fees. The whitepaper addresses the problem of high slippage and inefficient trading of stablecoins on existing DEXs, aiming to provide a more stable and cost-effective solution for users in the DeFi space. Curve's focus on stablecoins makes it a crucial component of the DeFi ecosystem, enabling more complex financial applications and strategies."
