Okay, here's the content for how3.io about Entangle (NGL), designed for retail investors new to crypto:

**1. Value Generation**

Entangle helps create stablecoins, which are like digital dollars. It makes money by charging small fees when people use its platform to create or manage these stablecoins. These fees are then shared with people who hold the NGL token, rewarding them for supporting the system. So, Entangle generates value by facilitating stablecoin creation and sharing the profits with its community.

**2. Market Position**

Entangle is known for making it easier to create and manage stablecoins in a decentralized way. Think of it as a toolkit for building your own digital dollar. Its main innovation is allowing anyone to create stablecoins without needing a central authority, making the process more transparent and accessible. This opens up opportunities for new types of stablecoins tailored to specific needs.

**3. Project Size**

While not the biggest name in crypto yet, Entangle is gaining traction in the stablecoin world. It's a relatively new project, but it's attracting attention because of its unique approach to stablecoin creation. As more people and projects use Entangle to build their own stablecoins, its importance and influence in the crypto space will likely grow.

**4. Real World Impact**

Entangle is used by people and projects looking for more control over their digital money. It's particularly useful in regions where traditional banking is limited or unreliable. By enabling the creation of stablecoins, Entangle can help facilitate easier and cheaper transactions, potentially boosting local economies and providing access to financial services for more people.

**5. Founders**

Entangle was created to address the need for more decentralized and customizable stablecoin solutions. The team behind Entangle consists of experienced developers and financial experts. While specific founding dates and individual names may vary, the project emerged from a desire to empower individuals and organizations with greater control over their digital assets.

**6. Problem Solving**

Entangle solves the problem of centralized control in the stablecoin market. Most stablecoins are managed by a single company, which can be a risk. Entangle allows anyone to create and manage stablecoins in a decentralized way, reducing reliance on central authorities and making the system more resilient and transparent. This is important because it gives users more control over their money.

**7. Strengths**

*   **Customizable Stablecoins**: The platform allows for the creation of stablecoins tailored to specific needs and use cases. This flexibility opens up opportunities for innovation and caters to diverse market demands.

*   **Community-Driven Governance**: NGL token holders have a say in the project's development and direction. This ensures that Entangle evolves in a way that benefits its users and the broader crypto ecosystem.

**8. Weaknesses**

*   **Complexity for Beginners**: Creating and managing stablecoins can be complex, even with Entangle's tools. New users might find the process overwhelming at first.

*   **Regulatory Uncertainty**: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is still evolving, which could impact Entangle's future. Changes in regulations could affect its operations and adoption.

*   **Competition**: The stablecoin market is competitive, with many established players. Entangle needs to differentiate itself and attract users to succeed.

**9. Whitepaper Summary**

The Entangle whitepaper outlines a decentralized protocol for creating and managing stablecoins.
