These tokens can then be used for discounts, governance (voting on platform changes), or simply held in hopes that their value increases.

**2. Market Position (70-100 words)**

Mocaverse is a decentralized exchange (DEX), meaning it allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without a middleman like a traditional exchange.

This makes trading and providing liquidity more attractive than on other DEXs.
