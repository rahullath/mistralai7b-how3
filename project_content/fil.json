Filecoin aims to solve the problems of centralized data storage, such as data breaches, censorship, and lack of transparency. By distributing data across a global network, Filecoin offers a more resilient, secure, and affordable alternative to traditional cloud storage solutions. The whitepaper details the technical mechanisms for verifying storage, rewarding providers, and ensuring data integrity within the decentralized network."
