This scalability is crucial for widespread adoption and real-world use.\n\n*   **Governance Model**: ICP's governance model allows token holders to participate in the network's development and decision-making processes. This ensures that the network evolves in a way that benefits its users and stakeholders."

This complexity may slow down adoption and limit the number of developers contributing to the ecosystem.\n\n*   **Centralization Concerns**: While aiming for decentralization, some critics argue that the initial governance structure had elements of centralization. The DFINITY Foundation's influence on the network's early development has raised concerns about long-term decentralization.\n\n*   **Adoption Hurdles**: Overcoming the established infrastructure of the traditional internet is a significant challenge. Convincing developers and users to switch to a new platform requires demonstrating clear advantages and ease of use."

Its core innovation is the \"canister\" smart contract system, which allows developers to build and deploy scalable and secure applications. The ICP token is used for governance, rewarding participants who contribute to the network's operation, and paying for computation and storage resources. The project aims to solve the problem of centralized control over the internet by providing a more open, secure, and democratic platform for building and deploying applications. By decentralizing the internet's infrastructure, ICP seeks to empower individuals and businesses, fostering innovation and reducing the risk of censorship and single points of failure. The whitepaper details the technical architecture, governance mechanisms, and economic incentives that underpin the Internet Computer's vision."
