The core innovation is the Cosmos SDK, a modular framework that simplifies the creation of custom blockchains. The ATOM token is used for staking, governance, and securing the Cosmos Hub, the central chain in the Cosmos network. The whitepaper addresses the problem of blockchain isolation by providing a standardized protocol for interoperability, allowing blockchains to share data and value. This enables the creation of more complex and interconnected decentralized applications, fostering a more efficient and scalable crypto ecosystem. The Cosmos Hub acts as a central router, facilitating communication between different blockchains. By solving the interoperability problem, Cosmos aims to unlock the full potential of blockchain technology."
