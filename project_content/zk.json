        "title": "Fast Transaction Speeds",
        "description": "Transactions on zkSync are processed much faster than on the main Ethereum network. This improved speed enhances the user experience and makes crypto more practical for real-world use cases.\n\n*   **Ethereum Security**: zkSync leverages the security of the Ethereum blockchain. While transactions are processed off-chain, they are ultimately verified on Ethereum, ensuring a high level of security and trust."

The use of zero-knowledge proofs and other advanced concepts can be difficult to grasp.\n\n*   **Centralization Concerns**: While zkSync is decentralized, some aspects of its operation may rely on centralized components. This raises concerns about potential points of failure or control.\n\n*   **Limited Ecosystem**: While growing, the ecosystem of applications and services built on zkSync is still smaller than that of Ethereum. This limits the options available to users compared to the main Ethereum network."

The core idea is to bundle multiple transactions together and process them off-chain, then use a zero-knowledge proof to verify the validity of these transactions on the Ethereum mainnet. This dramatically reduces gas fees and increases transaction throughput. The ZK token is intended to be used for governance and potentially for staking to secure the network in the future. zkSync aims to make Ethereum more accessible and usable for everyday transactions by solving the issues of high fees and slow speeds, paving the way for wider adoption of decentralized applications and crypto payments. The whitepaper details the technical architecture, security considerations, and roadmap for achieving this vision."
