It introduces Injective as a Layer-1 blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK, optimized for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The core innovation lies in its ability to support complex financial instruments, such as derivatives and futures, in a decentralized manner. The INJ token is used for governance, staking, and securing the network. The whitepaper highlights the problem of centralized exchanges and their limitations, arguing that Injective provides a more transparent, efficient, and accessible alternative. By enabling anyone to create and trade financial products without intermediaries, Injective aims to democratize finance and foster innovation in the DeFi space. The whitepaper details the technical architecture, consensus mechanism, and economic model that underpin the Injective protocol, emphasizing its commitment to security, scalability, and interoperability."
