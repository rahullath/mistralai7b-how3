      "description": "Stader ETHx helps you earn rewards on your Ethereum (ETH) without locking it up! When you stake your ETH with Stader, you receive ETHx in return. ETHx represents your staked ETH and the rewards it's earning. You can then use ETHx in other crypto applications to potentially earn even more, while your ETH continues to generate staking rewards. This creates value by making your ETH work harder for you.",

The core idea is to provide a liquid staking token (ETHx) that represents staked ETH, allowing users to access the value of their staked ETH while still earning staking rewards. The innovation lies in creating a decentralized protocol that enables users to stake ETH and receive ETHx, which can then be used in other DeFi applications. The ETHx token is used to represent the staked ETH and the rewards it earns. The project solves the problem of locked-up capital in traditional staking, enabling users to participate in the Ethereum network's security while maintaining access to their funds and maximizing their earning potential. The whitepaper details the mechanisms for minting and burning ETHx, the security measures in place, and the governance structure of the protocol.",
