Lido takes a small cut of the rewards earned by users who stake their crypto through their platform. This fee is how Lido generates revenue and sustains its operations. Token holders can also participate in the DAO's governance, influencing the future of the protocol.",

  "whitepaper": {
    "summary": "Lido DAO's whitepaper outlines a solution to the illiquidity problem in proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. The core idea is to provide users with liquid staking tokens (like stETH for staked Ethereum) that represent their staked assets. These tokens can be used in other DeFi applications, unlocking the value of staked assets and increasing capital efficiency. The LDO token is used for governance, allowing holders to vote on important decisions related to the protocol's development and parameters. By enabling users to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity, Lido aims to promote wider participation in PoS networks and contribute to the overall growth of the DeFi ecosystem. The project solves the problem of locked capital in traditional staking, making it easier for users to earn rewards and participate in the broader crypto economy.",
