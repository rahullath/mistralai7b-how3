Traditionally, when you stake your AVAX, it's locked up and you can't use it for anything else. SAVAX allows you to stake your AVAX and receive a token (SAVAX) that represents your staked AVAX. You can then use this SAVAX in other DeFi applications, maximizing the use of your assets and potentially increasing your returns.",

The core idea is to provide users with a secure and efficient way to earn interest on their crypto assets or borrow funds. SAVAX is a key innovation, allowing users to stake their AVAX and receive a liquid token (SAVAX) that can be used in other DeFi applications. The whitepaper highlights the problem of capital inefficiency in traditional staking and how SAVAX solves this by unlocking the value of staked AVAX. The BENQI token is used for governance, allowing token holders to participate in the decision-making process of the platform. Ultimately, BENQI aims to create a more accessible and efficient financial system for everyone.",
