The core innovation is \"Proof of History\" (PoH), a way to timestamp transactions and order them efficiently, allowing for faster processing. The SOL token is used to pay for transaction fees and participate in network governance. Solana aims to solve the limitations of existing blockchains by providing a platform that can handle a high volume of transactions at low cost, enabling a wider range of applications, from decentralized finance to gaming. The whitepaper emphasizes the importance of a scalable and efficient blockchain for the future of decentralized applications. Solana's goal is to make blockchain technology accessible and practical for everyday use.",
