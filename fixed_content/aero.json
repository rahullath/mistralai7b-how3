    "summary": "Aerodrome Finance aims to be the leading liquidity hub on the Base blockchain, a new network designed for fast and cheap transactions. The core idea is to create a decentralized exchange (DEX) that incentivizes users to provide liquidity (crypto for trading) by rewarding them with AERO tokens. These tokens give users voting rights, allowing them to influence the platform's future. Aerodrome innovates by building upon the successful Velodrome Finance model, adapting it for the Base ecosystem. The AERO token is used to reward liquidity providers, incentivize participation, and govern the platform. By providing a decentralized and efficient trading platform, Aerodrome solves the problem of high fees and centralized control often found in traditional crypto exchanges, empowering users to trade directly with each other.",
