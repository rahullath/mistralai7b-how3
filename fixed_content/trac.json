The core idea is to use blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent system for tracking products and verifying their authenticity. The TRAC token is used to incentivize network participation and pay for data storage and access. The innovation lies in its ability to connect disparate data sources and create a verifiable record of a product's journey from origin to consumer. This solves the problem of fragmented and untrustworthy supply chain data, enabling businesses to improve efficiency, reduce fraud, and build consumer trust. The whitepaper details the technical architecture, governance model, and roadmap for achieving this vision, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and open-source development.",
