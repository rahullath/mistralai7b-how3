    "summary": "Convex Finance aims to simplify and enhance the yield farming experience on Curve Finance. The core idea is to allow users to deposit their Curve LP tokens (tokens representing their share in a Curve pool) into Convex and earn boosted rewards without needing to lock up their CRV tokens (Curve's governance token). Convex aggregates these deposited tokens and uses them to vote on Curve's governance, maximizing rewards for its users. The CVX token is used for governance within the Convex platform, allowing holders to vote on important decisions. By streamlining the yield farming process and boosting returns, Convex solves the problem of complexity and inefficiency in the Curve ecosystem, making it more accessible and profitable for a wider range of users.",
