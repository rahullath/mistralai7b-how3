The core idea is to create a global brain where participants are rewarded with TAO tokens for contributing valuable information. This innovation aims to democratize AI development, moving away from centralized control and fostering collaboration. The TAO token serves as both a reward for contributors and a means of accessing the network's intelligence. The whitepaper details the technical architecture, including the consensus mechanism and the reward distribution system. Ultimately, Bittensor seeks to solve the problem of limited access to AI and the potential for bias in centralized systems by creating a more open and equitable platform for intelligence creation. The project aims to build a more intelligent and collaborative future by harnessing the power of decentralized knowledge.",
