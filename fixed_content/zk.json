The core idea is to bundle multiple transactions together and process them off-chain, then use a zero-knowledge proof to verify the validity of these transactions on the Ethereum mainnet. This dramatically reduces gas fees and increases transaction throughput. The ZK token is intended to be used for governance and potentially for staking to secure the network in the future. zkSync aims to make Ethereum more accessible and usable for everyday transactions by solving the issues of high fees and slow speeds, paving the way for wider adoption of decentralized applications and crypto payments. The whitepaper details the technical architecture, security considerations, and roadmap for achieving this vision.",
