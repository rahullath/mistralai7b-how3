The core idea is to move transaction processing off the main Ethereum chain, using a technique called \"optimistic rollups.\" This innovation allows for faster and cheaper transactions while still benefiting from Ethereum's security. The ARB token is used for governance, allowing token holders to participate in the decision-making process of the Arbitrum network. Arbitrum solves the problem of Ethereum's scalability limitations, making it more accessible and usable for a wider range of applications and users. By processing transactions off-chain and then settling them on Ethereum, Arbitrum significantly improves the efficiency of the Ethereum ecosystem.",
