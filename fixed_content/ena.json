    "summary": "Ethena's whitepaper outlines its vision for a decentralized, yield-bearing stablecoin called USDe, designed to be a more transparent and scalable alternative to existing stablecoins. The core innovation lies in its use of delta-neutral hedging strategies using derivatives to maintain price stability, rather than relying solely on traditional asset reserves. The ENA token is used for governance, allowing holders to participate in decisions about the protocol's future. The project aims to solve the problem of centralized control and lack of transparency in the stablecoin market, offering users a more decentralized and potentially higher-yielding option. By creating an \"Internet Bond\" through staking USDe, Ethena seeks to provide a crypto-native alternative to traditional savings accounts, fostering greater financial inclusion and innovation within the DeFi space.",
