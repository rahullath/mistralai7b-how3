It introduces the concept of smart contracts, self-executing agreements stored on the blockchain, as a way to automate and decentralize various processes. The core innovation is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum network. ETH, the native cryptocurrency, is used to pay for transaction fees (\"gas\") and incentivize network participants. The whitepaper addresses the limitations of Bitcoin by providing a more general-purpose platform for building decentralized applications, solving the problem of centralized control and lack of transparency in traditional systems. Ethereum aims to empower individuals and businesses with greater control over their data and assets, fostering a more open and equitable digital world.",
