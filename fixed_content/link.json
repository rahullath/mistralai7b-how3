    "summary": "The Chainlink whitepaper outlines a decentralized oracle network that connects smart contracts to real-world data. The core idea is to provide a secure and reliable bridge between blockchains and external information sources. Chainlink's innovation lies in its decentralized approach, using multiple independent oracles to verify data and prevent manipulation. The LINK token is used to incentivize oracle providers to deliver accurate data and to pay for the use of the network. Chainlink solves the \"oracle problem,\" which is the challenge of getting reliable external data onto blockchains, enabling smart contracts to interact with the real world in a trustworthy manner. This allows for more complex and useful smart contract applications across various industries.",
