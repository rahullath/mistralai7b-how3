  "whitepaper": {
    "summary": "The Immutable X whitepaper outlines a solution to the scalability issues plaguing the NFT market on Ethereum. The core idea is to use zk-rollups, a type of Layer 2 scaling solution, to bundle thousands of NFT transactions into a single Ethereum transaction. This dramatically reduces gas fees and increases transaction speed. The IMX token is intended to be used for staking, governance, and paying transaction fees on the platform. By solving the problems of high costs and slow speeds, Immutable X aims to make NFTs more accessible and practical for a wider range of applications, from gaming to digital art, ultimately fostering a more vibrant and inclusive NFT ecosystem. The whitepaper emphasizes the importance of maintaining Ethereum's security while providing a significantly improved user experience for NFT traders and creators.",
