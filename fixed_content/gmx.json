  "whitepaper": {
    "summary": "The GMX whitepaper outlines a vision for a decentralized perpetual exchange that offers low fees and minimal price impact. The core innovation is the use of a multi-asset pool (GLP) to facilitate trading, allowing users to trade directly against the pool rather than against other traders. The GMX token is used for governance and to reward holders with a portion of the platform's fees. The whitepaper addresses the problem of high fees and slippage on centralized exchanges by providing a decentralized alternative that is more efficient and accessible. By leveraging blockchain technology, GMX aims to create a more transparent and equitable trading environment for everyone. The GLP pool is crucial as it provides liquidity for traders, and the fees generated from trading are distributed to GLP and GMX holders, incentivizing participation and long-term growth of the platform.",
