      "description": "Avalanche helps people build and use apps and services, like trading platforms and games, directly on its network. It makes money by charging small fees for these transactions. These fees are then used to reward people who help keep the network running smoothly, encouraging them to hold and use AVAX, the platform's token. This creates a cycle where more activity leads to more value for AVAX holders.",

The core idea is to achieve high throughput, fast finality, and strong security through a novel approach to consensus. Avalanche introduces a family of consensus protocols that allow for the creation of multiple subnets, each with its own rules and virtual machines. The AVAX token is used for staking, governance, and transaction fees within the Avalanche network. The whitepaper highlights Avalanche's ability to solve the blockchain trilemma \u2013 achieving decentralization, security, and scalability simultaneously. By offering a highly customizable and efficient platform, Avalanche aims to enable a new generation of decentralized applications and services.",
