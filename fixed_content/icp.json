Its core innovation is the \"canister\" smart contract system, which allows developers to build and deploy scalable and secure applications. The ICP token is used for governance, rewarding participants who contribute to the network's operation, and paying for computation and storage resources. The project aims to solve the problem of centralized control over the internet by providing a more open, secure, and democratic platform for building and deploying applications. By decentralizing the internet's infrastructure, ICP seeks to empower individuals and businesses, fostering innovation and reducing the risk of censorship and single points of failure. The whitepaper details the technical architecture, governance mechanisms, and economic incentives that underpin the Internet Computer's vision.",
