The whitepaper addresses the problem of blockchain isolation by providing a standardized protocol for interoperability, allowing blockchains to share data and value. This enables the creation of more complex and interconnected decentralized applications, fostering a more efficient and scalable crypto ecosystem. The Cosmos Hub acts as a central router, facilitating communication between different blockchains. By solving the interoperability problem, Cosmos aims to unlock the full potential of blockchain technology.",
